# StarWarJSApi
HTML page to access REST API using JavaScript fetch

This is a basic HTML webpage that uses JavaScript to access the Star Wars JS API
to get a random character and then get their home planet and movies that they appeared in.

It does this by using the Fetch API to get the information over several calls.
